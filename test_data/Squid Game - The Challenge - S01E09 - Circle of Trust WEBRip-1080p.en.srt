1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,880
Mai is who she is.
Like, she can no longer hide

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,920
behind this facade
that she's been hiding behind.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,040
This "sweet lady."
Like, she can't hide behind that.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,840
<i>Attention, players.</i>

5
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,240
<i>Here are the results of the test.</i>

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,320
Oh God.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,440
Jump on in, Ashley.

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,600
Mai, would you like to join us out here,
or are you vibin'?

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,640
Even though she is not part
of the group,

10
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,680
I think Mai is awesome, and I'm so glad
that she's still in this game.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,600
She's someone
that I can really trust in here.

12
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,400
Whoo!

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,520
- Oh my God.
- Wow.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,240
It's gonna be at nine.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,240
It's gonna be zero-nine.

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,200
Single digit.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,920
I can't believe
I made it this far,

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,800
and I just hope that I can beat out
these other eight people,

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,000
you know, to make it to the final.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,640
Mai tried to take me out,
but it didn't work, so, you know,

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,040
I feel even better.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,080
And, you know,
I'm ready for whatever is to come.

23
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,360
We lost some great people today, guys.
We lost some great people today.

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,480
<i>The current prize fund
now stands at $4,470,000.</i>

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,160
The money has never felt real to me

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,145
until now.

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,760
And it's like something
I would dream about before,

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,320
but now it's like,
"No, there's a serious chance."

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
Oh man. Today was brutal.

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,880
We all got us through it.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,680
- Yeah.
- We all threw that die.

32
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,280
Yeah. Our… Our own choices kept us civil.

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
True.

34
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,240
I don't think any of us
would have gotten this far

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,600
without this close little group of us.

36
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,480
I'm also feeling that every time

37
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,200
I've thought that I could trust everyone,

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,360
someone just snaps,

39
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
and shows a side of them
that I didn't think was there.

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,240
Seeing how 287
nominated player 278 for elimination

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,040
kind of opened my eyes
that maybe I should just be being, like…

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,280
…a li…
a teeny bit more careful around her.

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,200
I still can't believe
what happened.

44
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,000
It's crazy. Like, she's walking around,
not talking to me, as if I nominated her.

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,985
Yeah.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,920
And then everybody's
walking up to her, "Oh, Mai, hi."

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,960
And she's still playing
this little lady role.

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,720
Bitch, you ain't fooling me.
I ain't fooled not one lick.

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,440
I work for
the Department of Homeland Security.

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,040
I'm an adjudicator. Um…

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,880
What an adjudicator does
is, uh, they review F1 visas

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,120
for non-immigrant students who want
to come over to the United States,

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,800
uh, to attend the universities.

54
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,760
In the beginning,
when I started the job in 2013, um, I…

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,280
My main goal is, you know, to help
as many, you know, immigrants as possible,

56
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,000
because I… I was an immigrant.

57
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,320
Um, so I came over in 1975,

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,400
so the feeling of displaced
and not having a home,

59
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,880
I can, you know,
feel their… their struggles.

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,440
But sometimes, you know,
I can't let emotion

61
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,240
get a b… get the best of me.

62
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,800
So I, you know… We, you know…

63
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,400
I have to, you know, set that apart
to make my job successful.

64
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,080
I was gonna always nominate myself.

65
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,680
Mai had a time where she just felt

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,640
like she needed
to play her game for herself,

67
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,320
and we cannot fault her for that.

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,480
- Yeah.
- Only person that can do that is Ashley.

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,520
Yeah.
I'm really proud of all of us.

70
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,840
- I am too.
- Seriously.

71
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,200
I… I love Mai.
I think she's lovely,

72
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,960
but I just didn't really understand
that decision at all.

73
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,400
We all decided what we were doing.

74
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,240
But I knew she was gonna do that.

75
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,600
Even though I lost my good friend,
who's been there through thick and thin,

76
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,040
I have to strategize the next game.

77
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,320
But I feel, um, alone.

78
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,200
It's hard, you know,
in that dormitory.

79
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,760
And I can't trust anyone in there.

80
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,960
I know I have to overcome
what I'm feeling…

81
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,480
…and to be strong…

82
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
for myself.

83
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,440
<i>Attention, players.</i>

84
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,600
<i>This is your wake-up call.</i>

85
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Good morning.

86
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,400
Oh, top nine!

87
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,280
Do you ever braid your own hair?

88
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
Uh, I tried. Yeah.

89
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,680
But not, you know,
as good as doing someone else's hair.

90
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,920
Oh, got you.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's hard.

92
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,040
It's funny because,
like, when we all came in,

93
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,240
it seemed like there were, you know,

94
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,120
a group here, a group here, a group here.

95
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,160
- But now we're all connecting.
- Yeah, last night…

96
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
Last night I was kind of thinking
we're lucky because, like,

97
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,320
you and I were a pair.

98
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,720
- Roland, um, Mai, they're a pair.
- Mai.

99
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
Um, Ashley is kind of with us.

100
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,480
- Yeah.
- Obviously, I wish that others were here.

101
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
But, for right now, you know,
I… I wouldn't have it any other way.

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,440
This is definitely, I think,
the best outcome that could've happened.

103
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,800
Having that sort
of mutual chemistry and trust

104
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,480
with… with, sort of, your "teammates,"
I think is very special,

105
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,920
and something that's often overlooked
in situations like this.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,320
Even if we are technically
all "against" each other,

107
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,760
I think that, as… as humans,
we're built to work together,

108
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,320
so, you know, having people
that you can depend on is very special.

109
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,880
- Oh, Sam.
- Yeah.

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
Come here for a minute, please.

111
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,000
Uh, I need to talk to you.

112
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,520
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

113
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,960
All right. Can we go in, like…
up the stairs or something?

114
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
Yeah.

115
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,600
I want to set the record straight

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,440
about why I chose
to eliminate his friend 278

117
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,560
so that way, you know,
he… he doesn't see me

118
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,800
as a, uh, a threat.

119
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
How are you?

120
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,720
Emotionally exhausted,

121
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,600
'cause Ashley is my good friend.

122
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,800
And when you nominated her,

123
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,440
I didn't… I didn't feel
any animosity towards you.

124
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,160
- I understand it's a game.
- Mm-hmm.

125
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,120
But I think we're all just agreeing on

126
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,720
a… a game of civil decency.

127
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Mm-hmm.

128
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,960
And I think that was everyone's rationale

129
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,000
with the self-nomination

130
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,320
because it very quickly
could have devolved into… chaos.

131
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,920
I've been in the navy for 20 years.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,120
It's all about camaraderie,
looking out for one another.

133
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,440
And when I stood on the Glass Bridge,
I thought I knew Ashley

134
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,080
until she showed me
that she… lack of teamwork.

135
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,000
Standing there,
not taking a risk for anybody,

136
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,440
and everybody who just takes over
to make that decision for her.

137
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,000
To me, that is selfish,
and I just wanted you to understand

138
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,480
that… it's not that Ashley
that I don't like.

139
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,800
It's… It's the character
that makes me look at her,

140
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,920
"Will… Will she have my back if…
in a situation of life and death?"

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,905
Right.

142
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,960
So I just want to understand that, um…
where I'm coming from.

143
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,280
I've been trying to play this game

144
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,320
in a way that I would be proud of

145
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,680
and that I would act in the outside world.

146
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,240
As long as we keep our eye
on our hearts and our humanity.

147
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,480
- Yeah.
- Because we all have that good core.

148
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,560
And that's… that's all we have
to keep our eyes on.

149
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,000
Player 287 has me uneasy.

150
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,840
I've witnessed her making decisions

151
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,120
that I personally wouldn't have made.

152
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,800
Decisions that seemed
like they came out of left field.

153
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,280
I think that the game has gotten to her,

154
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,440
and so I need to be
a little bit smarter about her.

155
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,880
Do you think she's open
for me to talk to her?

156
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,320
- She's always open to communication.
- Okay.

157
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,640
She will listen. We just have to all own
our decisions, like she said.

158
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,080
- Yeah.
- Oh my gosh, these benches hurt.

159
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,080
I see 278 as being not a team player.

160
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,120
But in my head,
I'm strategizing what's gonna be next.

161
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,520
And with that in mind, I need to apologize
without being too suspicious

162
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,680
'cause I have to save my ass.

163
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,880
So say you're at a social place,

164
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,440
and you see, like, a nice-looking girl,

165
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,080
um, and you wanna go up and talk to her.

166
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
Do you have any smooth pickup lines
that you would use?

167
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,400
Yeah, I do this really smooth thing
where I, like, just, like,

168
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,120
don't go up and talk to her.

169
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,400
I came into <i>Squid Game</i>
to meet people,

170
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,000
and I think that I'm also really enjoying

171
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,280
getting to know
the other players in the top nine.

172
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,680
And hopefully, they see the same in me,

173
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,840
and none of us come across
as any sort of threat.

174
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,480
Um, that's pretty good.

175
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,440
That's pretty good. Honestly.

176
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,360
I had a good childhood,

177
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,240
but I felt like I spent
a lot of time trying to prove myself

178
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,520
or prove that, you know,
I wasn't the pushover.

179
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,400
Growing up, I had my twin sister.

180
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,360
I would say
that my twin is my best friend.

181
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,520
We're complete opposites

182
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,920
in personalities, in hobbies, in demeanor,

183
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,760
um, but that still doesn't stop
the rest of the world from comparing us.

184
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,920
So, I love the girl,

185
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,400
but we've often been pitted
against each other, which sucks.

186
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,640
- Hi, Ashley.
- Hello, Mai.

187
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,280
- Can I talk to you, please?
- Yes. Yes.

188
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,065
- Come on.
- Okay.

189
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,200
Let's go talk.

190
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,600
- Dun-dun-dun!
- It's okay.

191
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,360
What's up, Mai?

192
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,080
- I want you to know…
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,400
- I love you as a person.
- Mm-hmm.

194
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,760
I don't know what happened up there,
but what I see…

195
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,240
- Okay, specifically, what did you see?
- Hold on. Hold on.

196
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,640
In the Glass Bridge,

197
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,880
when you didn't take a risk,
I didn't see you move, I was like…

198
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,040
What did you see?

199
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,400
That you didn't jump.

200
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,640
I jumped.

201
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,160
I turned around, after I passed,
I said, "Okay, y'all, I made a jump."

202
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,760
"I ain't moving no more. Everybody,
we need to work together as a team."

203
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,000
Right. Okay.

204
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,720
So it was shocking for your ass
to say that I'm not a team player.

205
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,280
I don't know what you saw or didn't see.

206
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,000
- But your girl was out front.
- Yeah.

207
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,600
- I know.
- And I took that chance.

208
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,040
Maybe my misperception.

209
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,360
- Something. Like…
- I should have talked to you first.

210
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,880
- But, you know…
- You could've talked to anybody.

211
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,160
- "Did she jump?"
- No, no. I wanted to talk to you first.

212
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,640
- But you didn't, Mai.
- I know.

213
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,880
I deeply apologize for that.

214
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,880
- Okay?
- Thank you. I received that.

215
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
- Okay.
- Thank you.

216
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,840
Thank you for talking to me.
I appreciate that.

217
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,800
- We good?
- We good. We good.

218
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,960
I receive your apology,
you get what I'm saying.

219
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,960
I'll give you this hug real quick,
real nice. I'll play nice.

220
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,640
But I see you.
My eyes are open to you, girl.

221
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,040
I know who you are.
You're playing your game, you know.

222
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,040
All right. Now stop being awkward in here.

223
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I know.

224
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,440
Oh, let me just sleep.

225
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,880
- I was cozy then.
- Me too.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,800
- It's a game.
- Oh, a game?

227
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,720
Attention, players.

228
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,000
It is now time for the next game.

229
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,560
Follow the staff into the game hall.

230
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,840
What is this?

231
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,760
Oh, my gosh.

232
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,280
- That's so strange.
- Oh, I don't like this.

233
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,440
Looks like there's
a little gift in the middle.

234
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
<i>Attention, players.</i>

235
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,160
<i>Please choose a seat.</i>

236
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,520
<i>Six players will be eliminated
in the next game…</i>

237
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,680
<i>Circle of Trust.</i>

238
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,920
<i>You will all be blindfolded.</i>

239
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,040
<i>If you are tapped on the shoulder,</i>

240
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,520
<i>please remove your blindfold,</i>

241
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,760
<i>take the gift box,</i>

242
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,720
<i>and place it on the desk
of the player you wish to eliminate.</i>

243
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,640
<i>That player
will leave the game</i>

244
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,320
<i>unless they can guess
who gave them the box.</i>

245
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,600
<i>If they guess correctly, they are safe,</i>

246
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,800
<i>and the player who gave them the box</i>

247
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,080
<i>will be eliminated instead.</i>

248
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,240
There could not be
a worse game than this,

249
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,480
because we're getting
to know each other more,

250
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,680
making it more trickier to eliminate you.

251
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,160
But the closer to the end I'm getting,

252
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,840
the more I know I need to break away
from being emotional with people

253
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,360
because it will come
when I need to eliminate someone.

254
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,560
This is so messed up.

255
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,720
<i>Players,
put on your blindfolds.</i>

256
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,480
I think it's a circle of distrust…

257
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,440
more so than a circle of trust.

258
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,040
So I have to be on my best game

259
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,360
and, um, to trust no one,

260
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,320
because I am a lone wolf in there.

261
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,960
<i>With that,
let the game begin.</i>

262
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Oh my goodness.

263
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,640
I can't be the first person
that… that the guard picks.

264
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,280
Who am I gonna pick?

265
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,280
I have to strategize
what's the best game plan

266
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,800
without everyone getting suspicious,

267
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,120
um, because Ashley and I
have our differences,

268
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,920
so it's too obvious.

269
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,240
But my dear friend Roland, I… I…

270
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,000
People will think
that it wouldn't possibly be me.

271
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,600
I love the guy,
but also I have to save myself first.

272
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,640
<i>Players,
please remove your blindfolds.</i>

273
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
Interesting.

274
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,760
<i>Player 418,</i>

275
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,560
<i>to save yourself from elimination,</i>

276
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,240
<i>you must guess correctly
which of your fellow players</i>

277
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,480
<i>placed the gift box on your table.</i>

278
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,560
Would anyone care to fess up?

279
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,760
No one's got anything to say?

280
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,080
- Nothing, Phill?
- Nothing, man.

281
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Mai?

282
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,160
Who's gonna do your hair?

283
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,080
That's a fact. All right, she's good.

284
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,520
But that was also pretty…

285
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,120
pretty pre-planned,
it kind of sounded like.

286
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,520
No, what, um… I'm saying is that…

287
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,120
- I trust you. I trust you.
- Okay.

288
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,080
What?

289
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,200
Wha…

290
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,920
Would you betray me
at this point, Elliott?

291
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,120
- You're my son.
- This early?

292
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,760
- You're my son, man.
- I respect that.

293
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,280
That'd be a bold move
if one of you two took me out this soon.

294
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
All right. All right.

295
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,000
I feel like I'm close
with all of you guys.

296
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,720
Hey, man,
I was in your position yesterday.

297
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,600
I ain't in no rush
to put a box on nobody's desk.

298
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,520
If you did have a box,
whose desk would you put it on first?

299
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,720
Mai.

300
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,720
- Ashley!
- That'd be a little obvious.

301
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,520
- So?
- Yeah, that's fair.

302
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,640
I feel like in the zone,
she would go for Mai.

303
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,145
You'd go for me?

304
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,960
- No, I wouldn't.
- Oh.

305
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,800
- You're my dawg.
- I know. You're my buddy, bud.

306
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Definitely not equally close
with all of you,

307
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,400
which is fair.
Everyone's got their homies.

308
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,760
Don't risk it.

309
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,720
Don't risk it? What's "it"?

310
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,880
Picking you?

311
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
Yeah.

312
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,640
I think the player
who gave me the gift box is…

313
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,640
player number 051.

314
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,360
I was just shocked.

315
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,120
I love you, Roland.

316
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,640
Love you too, Mai,
unless you placed it on my desk.

317
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,480
I feel bad that I picked Roland,

318
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,800
but I have to do what I have to do
to move forward.

319
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,560
<i>The next player
to be eliminated is…</i>

320
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,440
<i>…player 418.</i>

321
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Dang.

322
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,640
I honestly think 287
put that damn present on Roland's desk.

323
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,200
You know, she's sneaky,
and she'll stab your ass in the back ASAP.

324
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,520
<i>Players,
put on your blindfolds.</i>

325
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,640
I know I need to get out
of this desk quietly as possible.

326
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,600
And I also know I need to pick someone
who would never suspect me.

327
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,600
Amanda has always spoken out

328
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,560
about standing behind
the girls in the group.

329
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,640
I know she won't suspect me.

330
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,120
I've got to look around the room.

331
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,640
What do I remember before?

332
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,040
I need to look at Mai's jacket

333
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,360
because it was tucked in earlier,
so I need to have a look at that.

334
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,160
Can you sit up, please, Mai?

335
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,560
- Stand up?
- Sit up.

336
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,840
- Huh?
- Just sit up.

337
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Oh, sit up.

338
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,800
Be an easy one, wouldn't it, Mai?

339
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Any guesses?

340
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,600
I don't.

341
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,560
355, I think I could trust them.

342
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,360
- You okay, Sam?
- It's bright in here.

343
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
You okay, Phill?

344
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,960
But Phill's hair is different.

345
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,560
So-so.

346
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,840
Nice to see
someone sees me as a threat though.

347
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,200
I think the player
who gave me the gift box is…

348
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,080
…player 451, Phill.

349
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,760
<i>The next player
to be eliminated is</i>

350
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,600
<i>player 019.</i>

351
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,960
I might be feeling guilty

352
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,880
about my decision
to put the box on Amanda's desk…

353
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,880
…but by the same token,

354
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,360
I think $4.56 million

355
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,600
may soften the blow a little bit.

356
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,360
In these top nine players,

357
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,360
I do honestly believe
my biggest threat is Mai.

358
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,360
In every game,
she's always come out smelling of roses,

359
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,000
and some of us aren't really sure how.

360
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,040
So I'm gonna go for Mai.

361
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,600
And hope that she thinks it's Ashley.

362
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,360
In my profession as an adjudicator,

363
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,600
I analyze people.

364
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
I read people's faces.

365
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,640
Their eye movements

366
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,680
and the way they sit,

367
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,480
if they are fidgety,

368
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,560
and, uh, how they looked at me,

369
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,440
you know, to compile a result.

370
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,960
I'm confident, uh, to play in this game.

371
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,040
It is a very, very hard decision.

372
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,880
This is a crazy opportunity,
you know, and I'd be a damn fool

373
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,520
not to take advantage of it.

374
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,880
I'm definitely trying to look guilty.

375
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,240
I know we had our differences,

376
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,720
and I know you have a strong character,

377
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,840
but I don't think it's you.

378
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,840
Sam.

379
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,160
You have everything going for you.
We had our chat…

380
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,560
and it could be you.

381
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,360
Elliott.

382
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,200
I think that, uh,

383
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,280
it might be you.

384
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,880
Phill.

385
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,200
I just got to know you.

386
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,400
- And it's been a pleasure.
- It has.

387
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,520
So… I have made my decision.

388
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,520
Uh, I think the player is…

389
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,160
429.

390
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,000
Because he has been looking around

391
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,600
with a guilty look.

392
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,640
<i>The next player
to be eliminated is…</i>

393
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,280
<i>player 429.</i>

394
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,040
I had an idea that maybe Mai

395
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,480
wouldn't suspect it was me
and maybe one of the other players.

396
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,000
It was great to meet you all.

397
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,600
But ultimately I failed,
and she succeeded.

398
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,680
She's really intuitive.
She's a smart lady.

399
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,640
Mai has a good head on her shoulders.

400
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,760
Mai is so smart,
and this is a wake-up call for everyone.

401
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,320
This is hard, you know.

402
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,200
I have friends,
but, like, I don't have alliances.

403
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,840
I'm choosing player 451.

404
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
I've been very friendly with him,

405
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,240
but, uh, I haven't
really gotten close to him.

406
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,280
My heart sinks.

407
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,920
It's such an awful feeling
to see the box on Phill's desk.

408
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm afraid.

409
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
So,

410
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,120
one of you has tried to eliminate me.

411
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,960
I have my suspicions.

412
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Rose.

413
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,960
We never got to know each other too well,
and I feel like it's kind of my fault.

414
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,280
I could've approached first,
and I'm sorry.

415
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,360
Ashley.

416
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,760
You're a good person.

417
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,920
Thank you.

418
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,400
There can be only one decision today,

419
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,280
and I think the player
that gave me the gift box

420
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,560
is someone
who had to make a difficult choice

421
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,040
through no fault of their own.

422
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,000
I believe it was Rose, player 051.

423
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,640
<i>The next player
to be eliminated is…</i>

424
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,560
<i>player 051.</i>

425
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,600
Oh!

426
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,120
Yeah.

427
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,600
Bye, Rose.

428
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,120
Two more rounds.

429
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,840
I'm just hoping
I don't get drawn or get the box,

430
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,560
and then my place
in the final three will be cemented.

431
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,680
This game is savage.

432
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,000
I'm definitely not putting
my present on Mai's desk

433
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,960
because she's gonna guess me right away.

434
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,760
I will have to put my present
on someone's desk

435
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,760
who I'm, you know,
a bit more familiar with.

436
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,760
So I put the present on Phillip's desk.

437
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,160
We're pretty cool,

438
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,120
'cause no way
he would ever guess that I did it.

439
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,520
Here we go again.

440
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,520
Sam, my dude.

441
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,760
You've been talking
about us hanging out after.

442
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,600
Maybe it was all fake.

443
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Hallie.

444
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,520
It must be hard not being the person
with the most beautiful hair in the room.

445
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
And Ashley.

446
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,040
Friend turned foe, perhaps? Could be.

447
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,480
Or was it Mai?

448
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,240
So sweet. So gentle.

449
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,760
I have made my choice.

450
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,080
I think the player
that gave me the gift box

451
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:06,320
is someone that had to make a decision
that they did not want to make.

452
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,960
And I believe that this is a good person.

453
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,800
But I think the player
that gave me the gift box is…

454
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,320
…player 278, Ashley.

455
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,320
And it's not personal.

456
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,840
<i>The next player
to be eliminated is…</i>

457
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,440
<i>player 278.</i>

458
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,880
Bye, Ashley.

459
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,160
I did not
wanna hear those words.

460
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,960
I was trying not to look
all worried and shifty.

461
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,960
You know, I will never win my Oscar.

462
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,800
Came so close, but not close enough.

463
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,000
Please don't do that to me again.

464
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,640
My mind melts
that Phill has done it again.

465
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,200
He's like a superstar
at Circle of Trust at this point.

466
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,280
This is incredible.

467
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,840
<i>Attention, players.
This is the final round.</i>

468
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,400
I knew it was coming.

469
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,400
I feel like it could be any three of you,

470
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,440
because you guys
aren't gonna pick each other.

471
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,600
It'd be risky for you to pick someone
sitting right next to you.

472
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,960
But… you're very agile.
You're very athletic.

473
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,240
So I wouldn't put it past you.

474
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,480
And as Mai once told me,
you have a very innocent face.

475
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,880
But I know that you also
wouldn't put it on Sam's desk.

476
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,240
And I know that you know
that they're not gonna pick each other.

477
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,160
So, if you had put it on my desk,

478
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,560
your chances of not being guessed
are a little bit better.

479
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,000
It's so hard because Mai is shaking.

480
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,600
I'm always shaking. I'm always nervous.

481
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,400
Because this is the end.
This is the chance for the final three.

482
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,760
We're all nervous.

483
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,720
Player 016
is immediately nervous talking.

484
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,280
He's tense.
But then Mai is shaking like a leaf,

485
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,680
and in the past few days,
I've developed kind of a distrust of Mai.

486
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,680
I think that 451
is appearing to be the calmest.

487
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,120
Nah, I can't read them.

488
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,280
It's been real, guys.

489
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,720
I think that the player
who gave me the gift box…

490
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,680
…is player 287.

491
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Mai.

492
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,240
<i>The final player
to be eliminated is…</i>

493
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,000
<i>player 355.</i>

494
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,360
Bye.

495
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,720
I'm just kicking myself.

496
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,400
I let the events earlier this week

497
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,880
get in the way
of what my gut was trying to say.

498
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,240
And I wish
that I could turn back time

499
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,160
and be in that top three, but I can't.

500
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,440
That was the hardest decision
I've had to make in this whole game.

501
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,080
And it sucks.

502
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,160
I didn't have the heart to pick Sam.

503
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,440
He's been too good of a friend to me
this whole time.

504
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,400
So then that means
it's between Hallie and Mai,

505
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,640
both of whom are very sweet.

506
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:05,360
In that moment, I had to make a choice,
and so I went for Hallie.

507
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,800
<i>Players,
the game is over.</i>

508
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,560
<i>You will now return to the dorm.</i>

509
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,800
<i>Please follow the staff.</i>

510
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,720
It's okay.

511
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,240
Take the middle.

512
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:54,960
Oh my gosh.

513
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,560
This is so surreal.

514
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,360
It looks like
the water level rose or something.

515
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,520
How are you feeling, Mai?

516
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,680
My heart stopped for six sittings.

517
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,480
- Yeah. It wears on you.
- Yeah. Literally.

518
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,040
How… How many times
did you have to give someone the box?

519
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,360
Um, one.

520
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,600
And you, just once?

521
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,880
Just once.

522
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,040
I chose Hallie.

523
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
Roland, I wasn't expecting
right off the bat.

524
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,560
- No, me neither. That was tough.
- Who was… Who do you think put…

525
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,920
I genuinely have no idea.

526
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,160
- Did you?
- Hmm?

527
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,360
Did you put the box on Roland's desk?
Whose box did you put on the desk?

528
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,080
It was, uh… Um, who'd I put on the desk?

529
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,120
'Cause Elliott put it on yours…

530
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,320
I put it on Amanda.

531
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,480
- Oh, you put it on Amanda's desk.
- Wow.

532
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
Come on!

533
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,360
- My gosh, that was loud.
- Loud.

534
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,000
- I hated that. Come on, you guys.
- That was very loud.

535
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,080
Attention, players.
Here are the results of the sixth game.

536
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,840
Oh, man.

537
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,400
That is a lot of people.

538
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,960
Six players
were eliminated.

539
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
Wow.

540
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,440
It's no longer a game of trust.

541
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,320
One of us has to be a winner.

542
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
All bets are off.

543
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:58,760
The prize fund
now stands at $4,530,000.

544
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,320
Players 016, 287, and 451,

545
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,640
you are the finalists.

546
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,200
Shit.

547
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,840
The game
is all about self-preservation.

548
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,640
I have to do what I have to do to survive.

549
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,520
I will definitely do
everything I can to win.

550
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,800
You just don't know
anybody in here.

551
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,800
Money changes people sometimes.

552
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,640
You are the winner
of Squid Game.
